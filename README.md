# sphinx-llm

The `sphinx-llm` package includes a collection of
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) extensions for working with LLMs.

There are two categories of tools in this package:

- **Enabling LLMs and agents to consume your docs** - Produces additional build
  output for consumption by LLMs and agents. This is useful when you want your
  project to be well indexed and represented in LLMs when users ask about
  projects in your domain.
- **Leveraging LLMs to generate content dynamically during the Sphinx build** -
  Uses LLMs to generate content as part of the build process. This is useful
  for generating static content that gets baked into the documentation. It is
  not intended to provide an interactive chat service in your documentation.

## Installation

```console
pip install sphinx-llm

# For extensions that use LLMs to generate text
pip install sphinx-llm[gen]
```

## Extensions

### llms.txt Support

The `sphinx_llm.txt` extension supports the
[llms.txt v2 proposal](https://llmstxt.org/). It generates small Markdown
indexes that agents can search before fetching only the relevant LLM-friendly
pages on demand.

The supported v2 surface includes the defined `llms.txt` document structure,
per-page Markdown in append or replace URL form, scoped indexes at nested
paths, and HTML `alternate` and `describedby` discovery links. When nested
indexes overlap, each page discovers the most-specific index covering its URL
path.

`llms-full.txt` is not part of the v2 proposal. sphinx-llm can generate it as
an opt-in, non-standard convenience for consumers that still want one
concatenated file. Likewise, the `auto` and legacy suffix modes are
sphinx-llm compatibility features; v2 defines the append and replace URL forms
but does not require sites to publish both.

To use the extension add it to your `conf.py`:

```python
# conf.py
# ...

extensions = [
    "sphinx_llm.txt",
]

# Publish one of the two URL forms defined by the v2 proposal.
llms_txt_suffix_mode = "append"  # Or "replace"

# Nested indexes are part of v2 path scoping and are enabled by default.
llms_txt_nested_enabled = True

# Non-standard convenience output; disabled by default.
llms_txt_full_build = False
```

When you build your documentation with `sphinx-build` (or `make html`), the
extension will:

1. Build your documentation as usual
2. Automatically run an additional build with the
   [markdown builder](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-markdown-builder/)
3. Merge the build outputs together
   - Markdown paths follow the configured append or replace layout
4. Generate an index file for all the markdown files named `llms.txt`
5. Optionally concatenate all generated markdown into the non-standard,
   opt-in `llms-full.txt` convenience file when `llms_txt_full_build = True`

For example, in the default `auto` mode, if your `html` builder generates:

- `_build/html/index.html`
- `_build/html/apples.html`

The extension will also create:

- `_build/html/llms.txt`
- `_build/html/index.html.md`
- `_build/html/index.md`
- `_build/html/apples.html.md`
- `_build/html/apples.md`

llms.txt v2 names the two supported URL forms after how they transform the
HTML URL:

- **append** adds `.md`. For the `html` builder, `page.html` becomes
  `page.html.md`. A `dirhtml` page is available both with and without a trailing
  slash, so append publishes both `page/index.html.md` and `page.md`.
- **replace** replaces `.html` with `.md`: `page.html` becomes `page.md`, while
  a `dirhtml` URL such as `page/` becomes `page/index.md`.

The default `auto` compatibility mode publishes both append and replace
outputs. For a `dirhtml` build it creates:

- `_build/dirhtml/llms.txt`
- `_build/dirhtml/index.html.md`
- `_build/dirhtml/index.md`
- `_build/dirhtml/apples.md`
- `_build/dirhtml/apples/index.html.md`
- `_build/dirhtml/apples/index.md`

You can control which format(s) are generated using the `llms_txt_suffix_mode`
configuration option:

- `"append"`: Publishes the append output. For `dirhtml`, it publishes both
  `page.md` and `page/index.html.md`.
- `"replace"`: Publishes `page.md` for `html` or `page/index.md` for `dirhtml`.
- `"auto"` (default): Publishes the union of append and replace outputs.

The following values are sphinx-llm compatibility behavior, not v2
requirements:

- `"both"` is an exact alias for `"auto"`.
- `"file-suffix"` keeps its previous single output: `page.html.md` for `html`
  or `page/index.html.md` for `dirhtml`.
- `"url-suffix"` keeps its previous single output: `page.html.md` for `html`
  or the no-trailing-slash `page.md` form for `dirhtml`.

The two `dirhtml` forms `guide/page.md` and `guide/page/index.md` are different.
The first appends `.md` to the URL without a trailing slash. The second replaces
the `index.html` implied by the trailing slash. A nested index document follows
the same rule: append publishes `guide.md` and `guide/index.html.md`, while
replace publishes `guide/index.md`.

Each document has one canonical representation. Append and auto select the
`.html.md` output. Replace selects the `.md` output that replaces `.html`.
Each legacy compatibility mode selects its only output. `llms.txt`, the
non-standard `llms-full.txt` convenience, generated Markdown links, and HTML
discovery metadata all use this same target, so extra physical outputs never
create duplicate entries. Links inside each physical output use that output's
layout.

Generated paths selected by the configured mode are reserved for sphinx-llm and
are overwritten during a build. Other existing files are left unchanged; the
extension never guesses that an unselected file is stale or deletes it.

> [!NOTE]
> This extension only works with HTML builders (like `html` and `dirhtml`).

#### HTML discovery metadata

Each source-backed HTML page advertises both its canonical Markdown
representation and the `llms.txt` file that describes it. The extension adds
these elements to the HTML document's head:

```html
<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown" href="page.html.md">
<link rel="describedby" href="llms.txt">
```

The alternate link follows the same canonical output selected for `llms.txt`.
For example, an `html` page at `guide/page.html` links to `page.html.md` in
append mode or `page.md` in replace mode. A `dirhtml` page at `guide/page/`
links to `index.html.md` in append or auto mode and `index.md` in replace mode.
The `url-suffix` compatibility mode links to `../page.md`.

Both links are relative to the published HTML URL, so they continue to work
when the output is hosted below a site subpath. The `describedby` link selects
the most-specific generated `llms.txt` covering that page. Set
`llms_txt_nested_enabled = False` to disable nested `llms.txt` pages and
make every page link to the root `llms.txt`. Auxiliary HTML pages
without a Markdown representation, such as the search and general-index pages,
do not receive discovery links.

The v2 proposal also permits equivalent HTTP `Link` response headers. A static
Sphinx build cannot emit HTTP headers, so sphinx-llm emits the HTML elements
above. Deployments may instead configure their web server or CDN, for example:

```http
Link: </docs/page.html.md>; rel="alternate"; type="text/markdown"
Link: </docs/llms.txt>; rel="describedby"
```

Configure those headers at the serving layer; they are not generated as build
artifacts.

#### Configuration

Supported `conf.py` configuration options for `sphinx_llm.txt`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| **Name** | **Description** | **Type** | **Default** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `llms_txt_enabled` | Enable or disable all llms.txt artefact generation. Set to `False` to skip the entire extension without removing it from `conf.py`. Use `sphinx-build -D llms_txt_enabled=0` to skip on a per-build basis. | `bool` | `True` |
| `llms_txt_nested_enabled` | Generate v2 scoped nested `llms.txt` files and discover the most-specific index covering each page URL. Set to `False` for root-only generation and discovery. | `bool` | `True` |
| `llms_txt_description` | Override the project description set in `llms.txt` | `str` | Uses the project description from `pyproject.toml` by default |
| `llms_txt_build_parallel` | Build markdown files in parallel to the HTML files. | `bool` | `True` |
| `llms_txt_suffix_mode` | Markdown output mode. The v2 `"append"` form publishes `.html.md` and, for non-root `dirhtml` pages, the no-trailing-slash `.md` form. The v2 `"replace"` form replaces `.html` with `.md`. The default `"auto"` is a sphinx-llm compatibility convenience that publishes both and makes append canonical. Legacy compatibility values remain supported: `"both"` equals `"auto"`; `"file-suffix"` publishes only `.html.md`; `"url-suffix"` publishes only the previous `dirhtml` no-trailing-slash form and behaves like `"file-suffix"` for `html`. | `str` | `"auto"` |
| `markdown_http_base` | Optional absolute HTTP(S) base for generated sitemap and page-Markdown URLs, such as `"https://docs.example.com/project/"`. An empty value uses links relative to each `llms.txt`. HTML discovery links remain relative to the published HTML URL. | `str` | `""` |
| `llms_txt_full_build` | Generate the opt-in, non-standard sphinx-llm `llms-full.txt` convenience file and list it in generated `llms.txt` output. This file is not part of the v2 proposal. | `bool` | `False` |
| `llms_txt_exclude` | A list of Sphinx wildcard patterns matched against document names (not regular expressions or source paths) to exclude from `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`. `*` does not cross `/`, while `**` does; for example, `"reference/generated/**"`. The individual markdown files for excluded documents are still generated. | `list[str]` | `[]` |
| `llms_txt_override_source` | Advanced option that overrides the automatically generated `llms.txt` sitemap with the rendered contents of a custom Sphinx source document. Specify a docname or source path relative to the source directory, such as `"llms-txt"` or `"llms-txt.rst"`. | `str` | `""` |
| `llms_txt_summary_enabled` | Generate one-sentence page descriptions with an OpenAI-compatible provider. | `bool` | `False` |
| `llms_txt_summary_provider` | Summary provider. The initial implementation supports `"openai-compatible"`. | `str` | `"openai-compatible"` |
| `llms_txt_summary_model` | Model used for generated page descriptions. Required when generation is enabled. | `str` | `""` |
| `llms_txt_summary_base_url` | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible endpoint. An empty value uses the OpenAI client default. | `str` | `""` |
| `llms_txt_summary_api_key_env` | Name of the environment variable containing the API key. Set to `""` only for an endpoint that deliberately requires no authentication. | `str` | `"OPENAI_API_KEY"` |
| `llms_txt_summary_allow_insecure_auth` | Allow an API key to be sent to a non-loopback endpoint over plain HTTP. Use only for a trusted network where HTTPS is unavailable. | `bool` | `False` |
| `llms_txt_summary_max_input_chars` | Maximum Markdown characters sent to the provider. The complete page is still hashed for cache invalidation. | `int` | `12000` |
| `llms_txt_summary_timeout` | Provider request timeout in seconds. | `int` | `60` |
| `llms_txt_summary_cache_path` | JSON cache path. Relative paths use the Sphinx configuration directory; an empty value stores the cache under `app.doctreedir`. | `str` | `""` |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Each page's entry in `llms.txt` includes a short description. If a page defines
an `html_meta` description, that non-empty author-provided value always wins and
no provider request is made. In reStructuredText, use:

```rst
.. meta::
   :description: An author-provided page description.
```

In MyST Markdown, use frontmatter:

```yaml
---
html_meta:
  description: An author-provided page description.
---
```

When no authored description exists, enabled summary generation uses a cached
or newly generated description. When generation is disabled, which is the
default, the extension retains the existing first-paragraph fallback and makes
no provider requests.

#### Generated page summaries

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling page summaries sends rendered documentation content to the configured
> provider. Review that provider's privacy and data-retention terms before using
> this feature with confidential documentation.

Install the optional generation dependencies and explicitly enable summaries:

```console
pip install sphinx-llm[gen]
export SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_ENABLED=1
export SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_MODEL=your-model
export SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_BASE_URL=https://llm.example.com/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
sphinx-build docs/source docs/build/html
```

The summary options can be configured in `conf.py` or supplied through
environment variables. Environment variables are useful when local and CI
builds need different providers or models, or when you do not want to commit
those settings to `conf.py`. The available variables are
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_ENABLED`, `SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER`,
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_MODEL`, `SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_BASE_URL`,
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_API_KEY_ENV`,
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_ALLOW_INSECURE_AUTH`,
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_MAX_INPUT_CHARS`, `SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT`, and
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_CACHE_PATH`. Values resolve in this order: a
`sphinx-build -D` override, an environment variable, `conf.py`, then the
built-in default.
Installing the optional dependencies or detecting a local CLI does not enable
summaries; set `llms_txt_summary_enabled` explicitly.

`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_API_KEY_ENV` is optional. Set it only to read the key from a
different environment variable, for example
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_API_KEY_ENV=NVIDIA_API_KEY`; it names the variable and does
not contain the key itself.

The API key itself is read only from the named environment variable; it is not
a Sphinx configuration value and is excluded from logs, the cache, and cache
fingerprints. The selected credential is sent to the configured endpoint, so
set `SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_API_KEY_ENV` when a non-OpenAI provider uses a different
key. For an explicitly unauthenticated endpoint, set
`llms_txt_summary_api_key_env = ""`; this does not fall back to `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
Configured keys are rejected for non-loopback plain-HTTP endpoints; use HTTPS,
or a loopback URL such as `http://localhost:8000/v1` for local development. If
neither is possible on a trusted network, set
`llms_txt_summary_allow_insecure_auth = True` in `conf.py` or
`SPHINX_LLM_SUMMARY_ALLOW_INSECURE_AUTH=1` in the environment. This sends the
API key without transport encryption and should not be used on untrusted
networks.

The versioned JSON cache is stored in the doctree directory by default and is
written atomically. Cache entries hash the complete generated Markdown plus the
provider, endpoint, model, prompt version, input limit, timeout, insecure-auth
setting, and credential environment-variable name. Only the configured Markdown
prefix is sent to the provider, but a change anywhere in a page invalidates that
page alone. Restore
the doctree directory or configured cache path in CI to reuse summaries across
jobs.

#### Custom `llms.txt` override

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an advanced option for users who need full control over `llms.txt`.
> Most projects should use the automatically generated sitemap.

To write `llms.txt` manually while retaining Sphinx features such as cross
references, create a source document and configure it in `conf.py`:

```python
llms_txt_override_source = "llms-txt.rst"
```

The document is rendered with the other Markdown pages, then its rendered
contents replace the automatically generated `llms.txt` sitemap. All per-page
Markdown files are still generated normally, while the non-standard,
opt-in `llms-full.txt` convenience remains controlled independently by
`llms_txt_full_build` and is disabled by default. The custom source document
may be included in a toctree or marked with `:orphan:`.

Generated nested indexes place their link to the root index in an `Optional`
section. In v2, `Optional` is only a convention for secondary links; it has no
required mechanical omit or context-expansion behavior.

### Docref

The `sphinx_llm.docref` extension adds a directive that summarises and links
to another page. It uses the same `llms_txt_summary_*` settings, environment
variables, provider safeguards, and versioned JSON cache described in
[Generated page summaries](#generated-page-summaries). Generation is disabled
by default.

Enable the extension in `conf.py`:

```python
extensions = [
    "sphinx_llm.docref",
]
```

An empty directive opts into automatic generation:

```rst
.. docref:: apples
```

A non-empty body is a permanent, reference-specific manual override:

```rst
.. docref:: apples

   A reviewed explanation of why the apples page is relevant here.
```

A page can also set its own description using page-level `html_meta` when you
want this content to be static.

Summary generation follows this order of precedence:

1. Non-empty directive body
2. Target page `html_meta` description
3. Valid generated summary from the shared page-summary cache
4. Content-derived fallback when generation is disabled or a target is missing

The optional directive `:model:` setting overrides
`llms_txt_summary_model` for one automatic reference. Identical references
to the same target and effective settings generate at most once. Requests and
effective rendering state live in the Sphinx environment, while generated
records are also persisted through `llms_txt_summary_cache_path` so clean
builds and `llms.txt` summary generation use one inspectable cache.

Each successful build writes `sphinx-llm-summaries.json` to the output
directory. It lists each effective summary, its origin, target, consuming
source locations, and generated-summary metadata without endpoints, API-key
environment-variable names, or credentials.

#### Docref styling

By default, a `docref` title is prefixed with `See also:`, and its link uses
the text `Read more >>` and the CSS class `visit-link`. Configure these global
defaults in `conf.py`:

```python
llms_txt_docref_style_title_prefix = "Related:"
llms_txt_docref_style_visit_link_text = "Visit page"
llms_txt_docref_style_visit_link_class = "docref-link prominent"
```

Override any setting for one directive with `:style-title-prefix:`,
`:style-visit-link-text:`, and `:style-visit-link-class:`. Directive options
take precedence over the matching `conf.py` setting:

```rst
.. docref:: apples
   :style-title-prefix: More about
   :style-visit-link-text: Read the guide
   :style-visit-link-class: docref-link compact
```

Set an option or configuration value to an empty string to render no title
prefix, link text, or CSS class. Separate multiple CSS classes with whitespace.

The original `:title-prefix:`, `:visit-link-text:`, and `:visit-link-class:`
directive options, and the corresponding `llms_txt_docref_title_prefix`,
`llms_txt_docref_visit_link_text`, and `llms_txt_docref_visit_link_class`
configuration values, remain available as deprecated aliases. When a canonical
and legacy form are both set for the same value, the canonical styling form
wins.

## Making a release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions and any maintainers with write
access to the repository can create one in just a couple of steps. To create
a new release:

1. From `main`, create an annotated stable [EffVer](https://effver.org) tag
   with a `v` prefix (for example, `v0.0.0`; prerelease tags do not publish a
   release):

   ```console
   git tag -a v0.0.0 -m 'Version v0.0.0'
   ```

2. Push the tag to the upstream repository:

   ```console
   git push https://github.com/NVIDIA/sphinx-llm main --tags
   ```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build the package and publish
it to PyPI using trusted publishing.
