# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

`sphinx-llm` is a collection of Sphinx extensions for working with LLMs. It
serves two purposes:

1. **Enabling LLMs to consume documentation** - Generates `llms.txt` and
   per-page Markdown following the [llms.txt v2](https://llmstxt.org/)
   proposal, with an opt-in, non-standard `llms-full.txt` convenience file
2. **Leveraging LLMs to generate content** - Uses LLMs to generate static
   content during builds (e.g., the `docref` directive for page summaries)

## Development Commands

Prefer using Git worktrees for development.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv (recommended)
uv sync --dev --extra gen
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest src/sphinx_llm/tests/

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest src/sphinx_llm/tests/ --cov=sphinx_llm --cov-report=xml

# Run tests against a specific Sphinx version
uv run --with "sphinx>=7,<8" pytest src/sphinx_llm/tests/
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Ensure pre-commit hooks are installed
uv run pre-commit install

# Run ruff linter with auto-fix
uv run pre-commit run ruff --all-files

# Run ruff formatter
uv run pre-commit run ruff-format --all-files

# Run all pre-commit hooks (includes ruff, prettier, markdownlint, codespell,
# license headers)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Build the example docs (recommended for development)
uv run --dev sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build/html

# Build docs once
uv run --dev sphinx-build docs/source docs/build/html
```

## Architecture

### Core Extensions

**`sphinx_llm.txt` (src/sphinx_llm/txt.py)**

- Hooks into Sphinx's `builder-inited` and `build-finished` events
- Spawns a parallel subprocess running `sphinx-build -b markdown` to generate
  markdown files
- The `MarkdownGenerator` class orchestrates:
  1. Parallel markdown build (can be disabled via `llms_txt_build_parallel`
     config)
  2. Merging markdown output with HTML output (each page gets `.html.md`
     extension)
  3. Generating `llms-full.txt` (concatenated markdown)
  4. Generating `llms.txt` (sitemap with descriptions)
- Handles both `html` and `dirhtml` builders with different path structures
- Supports v2 `"append"` and `"replace"` URL forms via
  `llms_txt_suffix_mode`; the default `"auto"` publishes both as a
  sphinx-llm compatibility convenience. Legacy values remain supported.

**`sphinx_llm.docref` (src/sphinx_llm/docref.py)**

- Parses directives into pending nodes and collects unique requests in the Sphinx
  environment
- Applies authored directive and `html_meta` overrides before consulting the
  generated-summary cache
- Generates missing summaries at `env-updated` through the shared OpenAI-compatible
  client and `llms_txt_summary_*` configuration without modifying source files
- Stores requests and effective state in the Sphinx environment, persists generated
  records in the shared versioned page-summary cache, and supports purge/merge
- Writes `sphinx-llm-summaries.json` with effective summaries and provenance
- Requires the `gen` dependencies and an explicitly configured model for cache
  misses

## Test Structure

Tests live in `src/sphinx_llm/tests/` (not a separate `tests/` directory).
Tests use pytest fixtures that build the example docs in `docs/source/` into
temporary directories with different builders and parallel settings.

Key test fixture: `sphinx_build` - parametrized fixture that tests both `html`
and `dirhtml` builders with parallel and sequential markdown building.

## Commit Requirements

All commits by contributors who are not employed by NVIDIA must be signed off
using `git commit -s` (Developer Certificate of Origin).

Pre-commit hooks must be installed. They enforce:

- Ruff formatting and linting
- License header in all `.py` files (using `LICENSE_HEADER` file)
- Prettier for YAML
- Markdownlint for Markdown
- Codespell for spelling

## Version Management

Uses `hatch-vcs` for version management from git tags. Version is generated at
build time into `src/sphinx_llm/_version.py`.
